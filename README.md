# AlgorithmsHW6


Implement the quick sort and insertion sort algorithms and count the number of swap
operations to compare these two algorithms. Analyze the average-case complexity of the
algorithms. Compare the operations count in your report file to decide which algorithm is
better and support your analysis by using the theoretical average-case analysis of your
algorithms.
